# Collection App

(In Progress) Full stack application for tracking collections.

An open source application for tracking collections, be that Comic Books,
Trading Cards, Films watched, Stamps, or anything else you can think of.

## Project Goals

- Implement a generic interface for bespoke collectable creation such that users
can define their own structure for the items they collect. 
- Hosting and access flexibility; users can self-host the application or access
a web portal.
- Present users with dynamic and intelligent statistics about their collections. 

## Future Goals

- Importing Collection Data: Functionality to import collection statistics from
3rd party specific collection tracking applications (i.e. LetterBoxd, GoodReads, etc.)

## Contributing

The project is still in its early stages and is open to being shaped by the open
source community; any and all suggestions and contributions are welcomed.
